VERSION 0.1

List of things that need to be done to get to the next version:
1) Client needs to stop jamming the socket stream.
2) Simple authentication needs to be implemented.
3) All traffic needs to be encrypted.
4) Roles needs to be added.

Practical:
1) How will every user be authenticated?
2) How will userIDs be issued?

Problems:
1) The userID is generated randomly, but there to is no way have a userID persist.

2) There is nothing stopping clients from the same IP address from joining,
this vulnerability will allow for server raids and possibly even Denial of Service.

3) Client jams the socket stream. Netcat works just fine.
